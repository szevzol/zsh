"OSS is a big beast" (Joe Broderick)

"The cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that aren't there." (Gordon Bell)
"One of my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code." (Ken Thompson)
"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it." (Brian W. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger in The Elements of Programming Style)
"XML is like violence: if it doesn't solve your problem, you aren't using enough of it." (Heard from someone working at Microsoft)
"Threads [and] signals [are] a platform-dependant trail of misery, despair, horror and madness." (Anthony Baxter [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2005-July/])
"It's not that Perl programmers are idiots, it's that the language rewards idiotic behavior in a way that no other language or tool has ever done." (Erik Naggum, comp.lang.lisp)
"It's a curious thing about our industry: not only do we not learn from our mistakes, we also don't learn from our successes." (Keith Braithwaite)
"Unix is simple. It just takes a genius to understand its simplicity." (Dennis Ritchie)
PHP is a minor evil perpetrated and created by incompetent amateurs, whereas Perl is a great and insidious evil perpetrated by skilled but perverted professionals.
"Are you quite sure that all those bells and whistles, all those wonderful facilities of your so called powerful programming languages, belong to the solution set rather than the problem set?" (Edsger W. Dijkstra)
"Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves." (Alan Kay)
"If the designers of X Windows built cars, there would be no fewer than five steering wheels hidden about the cockpit, none of which followed the same principles . but you.d be able to shift gears with your car stereo. Useful feature that." (Marcus J. Ranum, DEC)
[Like programmers] prostitutes also think they all suck. And both, programmers and prostitutes, are right: they suck. The big difference is that prostitutes got the term "user-friendly" right.
"Every methodology I've come across has, at its kernel, a very small section labelled "do magic here"." (Katie [http://www.fysh.org/~katie/computing/methodologies.txt])
Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
Every language has an optimization operator. In C++ that operator is .//.
Theory is when you know something, but it doesn't work. Practice is when something works, but you don't know why. Programmers combine theory and practice: Nothing works and they don't know why.
A computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match.
Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.
"Program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence." (Edsger W. Dijkstra)
"Code never lies, comments sometimes do." (Ron Jeffries)
"I have found that the reason a lot of people are interested in artificial intelligence is the same reason a lot of people are interested in artificial limbs: they are missing one." (David Parnas)
Software is like entropy. It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the second law of thermodynamics; i.e. it always increases.
A fool with a tool is a more dangerous fool.
"The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code." (Robert C. Martin, Clean Code)
"If you want a product with certain characteristics, you must ensure that the team has those characteristics before the product's development." (Jim McCarthy and Michele McCarthy - Software for your Head)
"You can't have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families." (Jim McCarthy)
"Testing by itself does not improve software quality. Test results are an indicator of quality, but in and of themselves, they don't improve it. Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight by weighing yourself more often. What you eat before you step onto the scale determines how much you will weigh, and the software development techniques you use determine how many errors testing will find. If you want to lose weight, don't buy a new scale; change your diet. If you want to improve your software, don't test more; develop better." (Steve McConnell, Code Complete)
"An organisation that treats its programmers as morons will soon have programmers that are willing and able to act like morons only." (Bjarne Stroustrup)
"I have always wished that my computer would be as easy to use as my telephone. My wish has come true. I no longer know how to use my telephone." (Bjarne Stroustrup)
"One Page Principle: A specification that will not fit on one page of 8.5x11 inch paper cannot be understood." (Mark Ardis)
"Programmers are in a race with the Universe to create bigger and better idiot-proof programs, while the Universe is trying to create bigger and better idiots.  So far the Universe is winning..." (Rich Cook) 
"Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter." (Eric Raymond) 
"Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life." (Michael Sinz)
"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live." (John F. Woods)
"Every program has at least one faulty line of code.  Every program can be shortened one line.  Conclusion: Every program can be reduced to one single faulty line of code."
'Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I.ll use regular expressions.. Now they have two problems' (Jamie Zawinski, in comp.lang.emacs)
